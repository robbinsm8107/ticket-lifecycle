The first thing that we have done for this lab is create a few ticket examples. I first logged into the User Panel as 'Karen" and put in two tickets of different severity levels. I then logged in under the "Ken" user in the User Panel and put in another ticket of less severity that would still be something that needs to be taken care of. I liked the idea of creating three tickets which all have different severity and priority levels to have an idea of how the Administration Team may prioritize the ticketing queue. I set up the priority of these tickets to correspond with the internal severity levels of the issues presented within the tickets and assigned the tickets to an "Agent" with the proper permissions to handle such tickets. I set up the permissions for Jane to be a Level I Support Agent, who would more than likely handle the computer screen issue while John is Level II Support who would handle such Business Critical Issues. The idea would be that John would handle the Emergency ticket while Jane is handling the computer screen issue and in theory, these would take the same amount of time. Then they would be able to work together on the Marketing Application issue so that John has a chance to mentor Jane while she is gaining hands-on experience. </p>

I wanted to set up this screenshot to show the collaboration ability that the ticketing system can use. In this example, Jane and John already finished the original projects that they were able to do. Because both of those projects took roughly an hour, John was able to bring Jane onto this ticket as an opportunity to mentor. After John explained the situation and walked Jane through this, he then assigned the ticket for Jane to finish and follow up. This is a great opportunity to teach for John and for Jane to learn which helps both agents in maturing in their careers. </p><br />

This is an example of what a completed case may look like. This is a fake case so the timing may look a bit strange, but the point is that there are continuous updates throughout the case. John was able to provide a timeframe, show empathy, and let the customer know exactly what went wrong and what the resolution was all within the hour as agreed upon through the Service Level Agreement (SLA) that was negotiated between the Help Desk and the client. </p><br />
